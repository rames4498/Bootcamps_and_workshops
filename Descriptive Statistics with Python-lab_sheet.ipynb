Introduction to descriptive statistics\n","\n","\n","Descriptive statistics are numbers that are used to describe and summarize the data.

Measures of dispersion or variability\n","\n","\n","**Dispersion** is an indicator of how far away from the center, we can find the data values. The most common measures of dispersion are **variance**, **standard deviation** and **interquartile range (IQR)**. **Variance** is the standard measure of spread.

I have also described the measures of dispersion or variability (variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, minimum and maximum values, IQR) and measures of shape (skewness and kurtosis).\n","3.\tI have demonstrated how to calculate the summary statistics with `describe()` function.\n","4.\tI have computed the measures of central tendency-mean, median and mode for the `Revenue (in millions)`variable. I have found `mean > median > mode`. So, the distribution of `Revenue (in millions)` is positively skewed. I have plotted its distribution to confirm the same.\n","5.\tI have computed the measures of dispersion or variability-range, variance, standard-deviation, median and IQR for the `Revenue (in millions)`variable.\n","6.\tI have also computed the measures of shape-skewness and kurtosis for the `Revenue (in millions)`variable.\n","7.\tI find the skewness to be 9.3267. So, it is greater than 1. Hence, we can conclude that the `Revenue (in millions)` data is highly skewed.\n","8.\tI find the kurtosis to be 132.0456. So, it is greater than 3 and so excess kurtosis > 0. Hence, we can conclude that the `Revenue (in millions)` curve is a leptokurtic curve. As compared to a normal distribution, its central peak is higher and sharper, and its tails are longer and fatter.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.6"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":["Ss2GxYm1l_fG","Hv6yXx04l_fI","IbKLvF-hl_fK","ALvuteOyl_fL","TYHIFnwKl_fP","UTdbyqdbl_fS","b8b_iscCl_fV","Qbr1v3ccl_fX","aA1eBUH9l_fZ","aZ3cGmZWl_fb","fm2Rx_iIl_fd","4vbd9eiGl_fd","KlMCBqMMl_fg","-sPGGcv7l_fi","XxQZAmNll_fj","mrTakROgl_fl","j2ojOXszl_fm","AEqgNXnYl_fn","a94VYRcbl_fo","PlGRela4l_fp","fXsNrgsYl_fq","Uu0GpjqFl_fs","MMo2LtsXl_fu","B64hR36ll_fu","trsaBmYdl_fv"],"toc_visible":true}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
