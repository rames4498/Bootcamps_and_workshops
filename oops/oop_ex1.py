'''Create a Pets class that holds instances of dogs;
this class is completely separate from the Dog class.
In other words, the Dog class does not inherit from the Pets class.
Then assign three dog instances to an instance of the Pets class.
Start with the following code below. Save the file as pets_class.py.
Your output should look like this:

I have 3 dogs. 
Tom is 6. 
Fletcher is 7. 
Larry is 9. 
And they're all mammals, of course.'''
